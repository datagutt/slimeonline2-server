I have this old GameMaker: Studio 1.x game client for a MMO, but i am missing the original server files.
Can you plan a full rust reimplementation of ../slime2_decompile.gmx/ (this is a folder with a decompiled client version)
THey are using a weird network library called 39dll that i want you to replicate in rust as well, or replace it with compatible code.
This is found in ../39DLL

I want a full modern rewrite of the server. Create the plan

../slime2_mod_tool_decompile.gmx/ folder contains the moderation tools for the game.
../SlimeOnline2_Client_Modified/ contains the full built client
