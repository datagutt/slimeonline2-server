write detailed docs divided into folders and multiple files, that can be used as documentation for a future LLM agent to implement this SERVER IMPLEMENTATION in rust.
we want it to be as secure as possible without ever doing client-side changes.
It should be fully featured implementation with no shortcuts or todos
DO NOT ADD ANY CODE FOR "MORE SECURE" OR TLS ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THIS IS A LEGACY CLIENT, WE CANT CHANGE IT. THIS IS FOR LEGACY PRIVATE SERVER EMU ONLY
